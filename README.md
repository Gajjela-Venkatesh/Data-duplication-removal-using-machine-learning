Data Duplication Removal using Machine Learning
Overview

The Data Duplication Removal Project focuses on using machine learning to identify and eliminate duplicate data entries. By enhancing storage efficiency and reducing unnecessary data transfer, this project addresses a common issue in data management.
Key Concepts

    Data Deduplication: This technique removes duplicate copies of repeating data, improving storage utilization and speeding up data transfer.
    Machine Learning: The project employs machine learning algorithms, such as support vector machines and decision trees, to classify pairs of data records as duplicates or unique.

Project Summary

This project proposes a novel approach to detect duplicate records, particularly in digital gazetteers. It combines various similarity scores—like place names, relationships, and geospatial data—to improve accuracy in identifying duplicates.
Goals

    Efficiently detect and remove duplicates from datasets.
    Optimize storage through de-duplication.
    Store unique entries in a new file.

How It Works

    Data Input: The input dataset contains numerous duplicate entries.
    Analysis: Machine learning algorithms analyze the data to identify duplicates.
    Output: A new file is created containing only unique entries.
